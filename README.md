**Self-host [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) AI agents on Kubernetes with production-grade security, observability, and lifecycle management.**

OpenClaw is an AI agent platform that acts on your behalf across Telegram, Discord, WhatsApp, and Signal. It manages your inbox, calendar, smart home, and more through 50+ integrations. While [OpenClaw.rocks](https://openclaw.rocks) offers fully managed hosting, this operator lets you run OpenClaw on your own infrastructure with the same operational rigor.

---

## Why an Operator?

Deploying AI agents to Kubernetes involves more than a Deployment and a Service. You need network isolation, secret management, persistent storage, health monitoring, optional browser automation, and config rollouts, all wired correctly. This operator encodes those concerns into a single `OpenClawInstance` custom resource so you can go from zero to production in minutes:

```yaml
apiVersion: openclaw.rocks/v1alpha1
kind: OpenClawInstance
metadata:
  name: my-agent
spec:
  envFrom:
    - secretRef:
        name: openclaw-api-keys
  storage:
    persistence:
      enabled: true
      size: 10Gi
```

The operator reconciles this into a fully managed stack of 9+ Kubernetes resources: secured, monitored, and self-healing.

## Agents That Adapt Themselves

Agents can autonomously install skills, patch their config, add environment variables, and seed workspace files - all through the Kubernetes API, validated by the operator on every request.

```yaml
# 1. Enable self-configure on the instance
spec:
  selfConfigure:
    enabled: true
    allowedActions: [skills, config, envVars, workspaceFiles]
```

```yaml
# 2. The agent creates this to install a skill at runtime
apiVersion: openclaw.rocks/v1alpha1
kind: OpenClawSelfConfig
metadata:
  name: add-fetch-skill
spec:
  instanceRef: my-agent
  addSkills:
    - "@anthropic/mcp-server-fetch"
```

Every request is validated against the instance's allowlist policy. Protected config keys cannot be overwritten, and denied requests are logged with a reason. See [Self-configure](#self-configure) for details.

## Features

| | Feature | Details |
|---|---|---|
| **Declarative** | Single CRD | One resource defines the entire stack: StatefulSet, Service, RBAC, NetworkPolicy, PVC, PDB, Ingress, and more |
| **Adaptive** | Agent self-configure | Agents autonomously install skills, patch config, and adapt their environment via the K8s API - every change validated against an allowlist policy |
| **Secure** | Hardened by default | Non-root (UID 1000), read-only root filesystem, all capabilities dropped, seccomp RuntimeDefault, default-deny NetworkPolicy, validating webhook |
| **Observable** | Built-in metrics | Prometheus metrics, ServiceMonitor integration, structured JSON logging, Kubernetes events |
| **Flexible** | Provider-agnostic config | Use any AI provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, or others) via environment variables and inline or external config |
| **Config Modes** | Merge or overwrite | `overwrite` replaces config on restart; `merge` deep-merges with PVC config, preserving runtime changes. Config is restored on every container restart via init container. |
| **Skills** | Declarative install | Install ClawHub skills, npm packages, or GitHub-hosted skill packs via `spec.skills` - supports `npm:` and `pack:` prefixes |
| **Runtime Deps** | pnpm & Python/uv | Built-in init containers install pnpm (via corepack) or Python 3.12 + uv for MCP servers and skills |
| **Auto-Update** | OCI registry polling | Opt-in version tracking: checks the registry for new semver releases, backs up first, rolls out, and auto-rolls back if the new version fails health checks |
| **Scalable** | Auto-scaling | HPA integration with CPU and memory metrics, min/max replica bounds, automatic StatefulSet replica management |
| **Resilient** | Self-healing lifecycle | PodDisruptionBudgets, health probes, automatic config rollouts via content hashing, 5-minute drift detection |
| **Backup/Restore** | S3-backed snapshots | Automatic backup to S3-compatible storage on deletion, pre-update, and on a cron schedule; restore into a new instance from any snapshot |
| **Workspace Seeding** | Initial files & dirs | Pre-populate the workspace with files and directories before the agent starts |
| **Gateway Auth** | Auto-generated tokens | Automatic gateway token Secret per instance, bypassing mDNS pairing (unusable in k8s) |
| **Tailscale** | Tailnet access | Expose via Tailscale Serve or Funnel with SSO auth - no Ingress needed |
| **Extensible** | Sidecars & init containers | Chromium for browser automation, Ollama for local LLMs, Tailscale for tailnet access, plus custom init containers and sidecars |
| **Cloud Native** | SA annotations & CA bundles | AWS IRSA / GCP Workload Identity via ServiceAccount annotations; CA bundle injection for corporate proxies |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.28+
- Helm 3

### 1. Install the operator

```bash
helm install openclaw-operator \
  oci://ghcr.io/openclaw-rocks/charts/openclaw-operator \
  --namespace openclaw-operator-system \
  --create-namespace
```

<details>
<summary>Alternative: install with Kustomize</summary>

```bash
# Install CRDs
make install

# Deploy the operator
make deploy IMG=ghcr.io/openclaw-rocks/openclaw-operator:latest
```

</details>

### 2. Create a secret with your API keys

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: openclaw-api-keys
type: Opaque
stringData:
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: "sk-ant-..."
```

### 3. Deploy an OpenClaw instance

```yaml
apiVersion: openclaw.rocks/v1alpha1
kind: OpenClawInstance
metadata:
  name: my-agent
spec:
  envFrom:
    - secretRef:
        name: openclaw-api-keys
  storage:
    persistence:
      enabled: true
      size: 10Gi
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f secret.yaml -f openclawinstance.yaml
```

### 4. Verify

```bash
kubectl get openclawinstances
# NAME       PHASE     AGE
# my-agent   Running   2m

kubectl get pods
# NAME         READY   STATUS    AGE
# my-agent-0   1/1     Running   2m
```

## Configuration

### Inline config (openclaw.json)

```yaml
spec:
  config:
    raw:
      agents:
        defaults:
          model:
            primary: "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514"
          sandbox: true
      session:
        scope: "per-sender"
```

### External ConfigMap reference

```yaml
spec:
  config:
    configMapRef:
      name: my-openclaw-config
      key: openclaw.json
```

Config changes are detected via SHA-256 hashing and automatically trigger a rolling update. No manual restart needed.

### Gateway authentication

The operator automatically generates a gateway token Secret for each instance and injects it into both the config JSON (`gateway.auth.mode: token`) and the `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` env var. This bypasses Bonjour/mDNS pairing, which is unusable in Kubernetes.

- The token is generated once and never overwritten - rotate it by editing the Secret directly
- If you set `gateway.auth.token` in your config or `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` in `spec.env`, your value takes precedence
- To bring your own token Secret, set `spec.gateway.existingSecret` - the operator will use it instead of auto-generating one (the Secret must have a key named `token`)
- The operator automatically sets `gateway.controlUi.dangerouslyDisableDeviceAuth: true` - device pairing is incompatible with Kubernetes (users cannot approve pairing from inside a container, connections are always proxied, and mDNS is unavailable)
- **Do not set `gateway.mode: local`** in your config - this mode is for desktop installs and enforces device identity checks that cannot work behind a reverse proxy in Kubernetes
- When connecting to the Control UI through an Ingress, pass the gateway token in the URL fragment: `https://openclaw.example.com/#token=<your-token>`
- Since v2026.2.24, OpenClaw restricts `gateway.allowedOrigins` to same-origin by default - if accessing via a non-default hostname (e.g. Ingress), set `gateway.allowedOrigins: ["*"]` in your config

### Control UI allowed origins

The operator auto-injects `gateway.controlUi.allowedOrigins` so the Control UI works through reverse proxies without CORS errors. Origins are derived from:

- **Localhost** (always): `http://localhost:18789`, `http://127.0.0.1:18789` for port-forwarding
- **Ingress hosts**: scheme determined from TLS config (`https://` if TLS, `http://` otherwise)
- **Explicit extras**: `spec.gateway.controlUiOrigins` for custom proxy URLs

If you set `gateway.controlUi.allowedOrigins` directly in your config JSON, the operator will not override it.

### Chromium sidecar

Enable headless browser automation for web scraping, screenshots, and browser-based integrations:

```yaml
spec:
  chromium:
    enabled: true
    image:
      repository: ghcr.io/browserless/chromium
      tag: "v2.0.0"
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: "250m"
        memory: "512Mi"
      limits:
        cpu: "1000m"
        memory: "2Gi"
    # Pass extra flags to the Chromium process (appended to built-in anti-bot defaults)
    extraArgs:
      - "--user-agent=Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36"
    # Inject extra environment variables into the sidecar
    extraEnv:
      - name: DEFAULT_STEALTH
        value: "true"
```

When enabled, the operator automatically:
- Injects a `CHROMIUM_URL` environment variable into the main container
- Configures browser profiles in the OpenClaw config - both `"default"` and `"chrome"` profiles are set to point at the sidecar's CDP endpoint, so browser tool calls work regardless of which profile name the LLM passes
- Sets up shared memory, security contexts, and health probes for the sidecar
- Applies anti-bot-detection flags by default (`--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled`, `--disable-features=AutomationControlled`, `--no-first-run`)

#### Persistent browser profiles

By default, all browser state (cookies, localStorage, session tokens) is lost on pod restart. Enable persistence to retain browser profiles across restarts:

```yaml
spec:
  chromium:
    enabled: true
    persistence:
      enabled: true          # default: false
      storageClass: ""        # optional - uses cluster default if empty
      size: "1Gi"             # default: 1Gi
      existingClaim: ""       # optional - use a pre-existing PVC
```

When persistence is enabled, the operator creates a dedicated PVC and passes `--user-data-dir=/chromium-data` to Chrome so that cookies, localStorage, IndexedDB, cached credentials, and session tokens survive pod restarts. This is useful for authenticated browser automation, MFA-protected services, and long-running browser workflows.

**Security note:** Persistent browser profiles contain sensitive session tokens. The PVC has the same security posture as other instance volumes. Ensure your StorageClass supports encryption at rest for sensitive workloads.

### Ollama sidecar

Run local LLMs alongside your agent for private, low-latency inference without external API calls:

```yaml
spec:
  ollama:
    enabled: true
    models:
      - llama3.2
      - nomic-embed-text
    gpu: 1
    storage:
      sizeLimit: 30Gi
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: "1"
        memory: "4Gi"
      limits:
        cpu: "4"
        memory: "16Gi"
```

When enabled, the operator:
- Injects an `OLLAMA_HOST` environment variable into the main container
- Pre-pulls specified models via an init container before the agent starts
- Configures GPU resource limits when `gpu` is set (`nvidia.com/gpu`)
- Mounts a model cache volume (emptyDir by default, or an existing PVC via `storage.existingClaim`)

See [Custom AI Providers](docs/custom-providers.md) for configuring OpenClaw to use Ollama models via environment variables.

### Web terminal sidecar

Provide browser-based shell access to running instances for debugging and inspection without requiring `kubectl exec`:

```yaml
spec:
  webTerminal:
    enabled: true
    readOnly: false
    credential:
      secretRef:
        name: my-terminal-creds
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: "50m"
        memory: "64Mi"
      limits:
        cpu: "200m"
        memory: "128Mi"
```

When enabled, the operator:
- Injects a [ttyd](https://github.com/tsl0922/ttyd) sidecar container on port 7681
- Mounts the instance data volume at `/home/openclaw/.openclaw` so you can inspect config, logs, and data files
- Adds the web terminal port to the Service and NetworkPolicy for external access
- Supports basic auth via a Secret with `username` and `password` keys
- Supports read-only mode (`readOnly: true`) for production environments where shell input should be disabled

### Tailscale integration

Expose your instance via [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) Serve (tailnet-only) or Funnel (public internet) - no Ingress or LoadBalancer needed:

```yaml
spec:
  tailscale:
    enabled: true
    mode: serve          # "serve" (tailnet only) or "funnel" (public internet)
    authKeySecretRef:
      name: tailscale-auth
    authSSO: true        # allow passwordless login for tailnet members
    hostname: my-agent   # defaults to instance name
    image:
      repository: ghcr.io/tailscale/tailscale  # default
      tag: latest
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: 50m
        memory: 64Mi
      limits:
        cpu: 200m
        memory: 256Mi
```

When enabled, the operator runs a **Tailscale sidecar** (`tailscaled`) that handles serve/funnel declaratively via `TS_SERVE_CONFIG`. An **init container** copies the `tailscale` CLI binary to a shared volume so the main container can call `tailscale whois` for SSO authentication. The sidecar runs in userspace mode (`TS_USERSPACE=true`) - no `NET_ADMIN` capability needed.

**State persistence:** Tailscale node identity and TLS certificates are automatically persisted to a Kubernetes Secret (`<instance>-ts-state`) via `TS_KUBE_SECRET`. This prevents hostname incrementing (device-1, device-2, ...) and Let's Encrypt certificate re-issuance across pod restarts. The operator pre-creates the state Secret, grants the pod's ServiceAccount `get/update/patch` access to it, and mounts the SA token automatically.

Use ephemeral+reusable auth keys from the [Tailscale admin console](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/keys). When `authSSO` is enabled, tailnet members can authenticate without a gateway token.

### Config merge mode

By default, the operator overwrites the config file on every pod restart. Set `mergeMode: merge` to deep-merge operator config with existing PVC config, preserving runtime changes made by the agent:

```yaml
spec:
  config:
    mergeMode: merge
    raw:
      agents:
        defaults:
          model:
            primary: "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514"
```

**Caveat:** In merge mode, removing a key from the CR does not remove it from the PVC config - the old value persists because deep-merge only adds or updates keys. If you need to remove stale config keys (e.g., after removing `gateway.mode: local`), temporarily switch to `mergeMode: replace`, apply, wait for the pod to restart, then switch back to `merge`.

### Skill installation

Install skills declaratively. The operator runs an init container that fetches each skill before the agent starts. Entries use ClawHub by default, or prefix with `npm:` to install from npmjs.com. ClawHub installs are idempotent - if a skill is already installed (e.g., when using persistent storage), it is skipped rather than failing:

```yaml
spec:
  skills:
    - "@anthropic/mcp-server-fetch"       # ClawHub (default)
    - "npm:@openclaw/matrix"              # npm package from npmjs.com
```

npm lifecycle scripts are disabled globally on the init container (`NPM_CONFIG_IGNORE_SCRIPTS=true`) to mitigate supply chain attacks.

### Skill packs

Skill packs bundle multiple files (SKILL.md, scripts, config) into a single installable unit hosted on GitHub. Use the `pack:` prefix with `owner/repo/path` format:

```yaml
spec:
  skills:
    - "pack:openclaw-rocks/skills/image-gen"            # latest from default branch
    - "pack:openclaw-rocks/skills/image-gen@v1.0.0"     # pinned to tag
    - "pack:myorg/private-skills/custom-tool@main"       # private repo (requires GITHUB_TOKEN)
```

Each pack directory must contain a `skillpack.json` manifest:

```json
{
  "files": {
    "skills/image-gen/SKILL.md": "SKILL.md",
    "skills/image-gen/scripts/generate.py": "scripts/generate.py"
  },
  "directories": ["skills/image-gen/scripts"],
  "config": {
    "image-gen": {"enabled": true}
  }
}
```

The operator resolves packs via the GitHub Contents API (cached for 5 minutes), seeds files into the workspace via the init container, and injects config entries into `config.raw.skills.entries` (user overrides take precedence). Set `GITHUB_TOKEN` on the operator deployment for private repo access.

### Self-configure

Allow agents to modify their own configuration by creating `OpenClawSelfConfig` resources via the K8s API. The operator validates each request against the instance's `allowedActions` policy before applying changes:

```yaml
spec:
  selfConfigure:
    enabled: true
    allowedActions:
      - skills        # add/remove skills
      - config        # patch openclaw.json
      - workspaceFiles # add/remove workspace files
      - envVars       # add/remove environment variables
```

When enabled, the operator:
- Grants the instance's ServiceAccount RBAC permissions to read its own CRD and create `OpenClawSelfConfig` resources
- Enables SA token automounting so the agent can authenticate with the K8s API
- Injects a `SELFCONFIG.md` skill file and `selfconfig.sh` helper script into the workspace
- Opens port 6443 egress in the NetworkPolicy for K8s API access

The agent creates a request like:

```yaml
apiVersion: openclaw.rocks/v1alpha1
kind: OpenClawSelfConfig
metadata:
  name: add-fetch-skill
spec:
  instanceRef: my-agent
  addSkills:
    - "@anthropic/mcp-server-fetch"
```

The operator validates the request, applies it to the parent `OpenClawInstance`, and sets the request's status to `Applied`, `Denied`, or `Failed`. Terminal requests are auto-deleted after 1 hour.

See the [API reference](docs/api-reference.md) for the full `OpenClawSelfConfig` CRD spec and `spec.selfConfigure` fields.

### Persistent storage

By default the operator creates a 10Gi PVC and retains it when the CR is deleted (orphan behavior). Override size, storage class, or retention:

```yaml
spec:
  storage:
    persistence:
      size: 20Gi
      storageClass: fast-ssd
      orphan: true   # default -- PVC is RETAINED when the CR is deleted
      # orphan: false  -- PVC is deleted with the CR (garbage collected)
```

To reuse an existing PVC (e.g., after restoring from a backup):

```yaml
spec:
  storage:
    persistence:
      existingClaim: my-agent-data
```

> **Retention is stateful data protection.** Because agent workspaces contain irreplaceable data such as memory, notebooks, and conversation history, the default is `orphan: true`. To re-attach a retained PVC to a new instance, set `existingClaim` to its name.

### Runtime dependencies

Enable built-in init containers that install pnpm or Python/uv to the data PVC for MCP servers and skills:

```yaml
spec:
  runtimeDeps:
    pnpm: true    # Installs pnpm via corepack
    python: true  # Installs Python 3.12 + uv
```

### Custom init containers and sidecars

Add custom init containers (run after operator-managed ones) and sidecar containers:

```yaml
spec:
  initContainers:
    - name: fetch-models
      image: curlimages/curl:8.5.0
      command: ["sh", "-c", "curl -o /data/model.bin https://..."]
      volumeMounts:
        - name: data
          mountPath: /data
  sidecars:
    - name: cloud-sql-proxy
      image: gcr.io/cloud-sql-connectors/cloud-sql-proxy:2.14.3
      args: ["--structured-logs", "my-project:us-central1:my-db"]
      ports:
        - containerPort: 5432
  sidecarVolumes:
    - name: proxy-creds
      secret:
        secretName: cloud-sql-proxy-sa
```

Reserved init container names (`init-config`, `init-pnpm`, `init-python`, `init-skills`, `init-ollama`) are rejected by the webhook.

### Extra volumes and mounts

Mount additional ConfigMaps, Secrets, or CSI volumes into the main container:

```yaml
spec:
  extraVolumes:
    - name: shared-data
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: shared-pvc
  extraVolumeMounts:
    - name: shared-data
      mountPath: /shared
```

### Ingress Basic Auth

Add HTTP Basic Authentication to the Ingress. The operator auto-generates a random password and stores it in a managed Secret:

```yaml
spec:
  networking:
    ingress:
      enabled: true
      className: nginx
      hosts:
        - host: my-agent.example.com
      security:
        basicAuth:
          enabled: true
          username: admin          # default: "openclaw"
          realm: "My Agent"        # default: "OpenClaw"
```

The generated Secret is named `<name>-basic-auth` and contains three keys: `auth` (htpasswd format for ingress controllers), `username`, and `password` (plaintext, for retrieving the auto-generated credentials). It is tracked in `status.managedResources.basicAuthSecret`. To use your own credentials, provide a pre-formatted htpasswd Secret:

```yaml
spec:
  networking:
    ingress:
      security:
        basicAuth:
          enabled: true
          existingSecret: my-htpasswd-secret  # must contain key "auth"
```

For Traefik ingress, a `Middleware` CRD resource is created automatically (requires Traefik CRDs installed).

### Custom service ports

By default the operator creates a Service with the gateway (18789) and canvas (18793) ports. To expose custom ports instead (e.g., for a non-default application), set `spec.networking.service.ports`:

```yaml
spec:
  networking:
    service:
      type: ClusterIP
      ports:
        - name: http
          port: 3978
          targetPort: 3978
```

When `ports` is set, it fully replaces the default ports -- including the Chromium port if the sidecar is enabled. To keep the defaults alongside custom ports, include them explicitly. If `targetPort` is omitted it defaults to `port`. See the [API reference](docs/api-reference.md#specnetworkingservice) for all fields.

### CA bundle injection

Inject a custom CA certificate bundle for environments with TLS-intercepting proxies or private CAs:

```yaml
spec:
  security:
    caBundle:
      configMapName: corporate-ca-bundle  # or secretName
      key: ca-bundle.crt                  # default key name
```

The bundle is mounted into all containers and the `SSL_CERT_FILE` / `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` environment variables are set automatically.

### ServiceAccount annotations

Add annotations to the managed ServiceAccount for cloud provider integrations:

```yaml
spec:
  security:
    rbac:
      serviceAccountAnnotations:
        # AWS IRSA
        eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: "arn:aws:iam::123456789:role/openclaw"
        # GCP Workload Identity
        # iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account: "openclaw@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
```

### Auto-update

Opt into automatic version tracking so the operator detects new releases and rolls them out without manual intervention:

```yaml
spec:
  autoUpdate:
    enabled: true
    checkInterval: "24h"         # how often to poll the registry (1h-168h)
    backupBeforeUpdate: true     # back up the PVC before applying an update
    rollbackOnFailure: true      # auto-rollback if the new version fails health checks
    healthCheckTimeout: "10m"    # how long to wait for the pod to become ready (2m-30m)
```

When enabled, the operator resolves `latest` to the highest stable semver tag on creation, then polls for newer versions on each `checkInterval`. Before updating, it optionally runs an S3 backup, then patches the image tag and monitors the rollout. If the pod fails to become ready within `healthCheckTimeout`, it reverts the image tag and (optionally) restores the PVC from the pre-update snapshot.

Safety mechanisms include failed-version tracking (skips versions that failed health checks), a circuit breaker (pauses after 3 consecutive rollbacks), and full data restore when `backupBeforeUpdate` is enabled. Auto-update is a no-op for digest-pinned images (`spec.image.digest`).

See `status.autoUpdate` for update progress: `kubectl get openclawinstance my-agent -o jsonpath='{.status.autoUpdate}'`

### Backup and restore

The operator uses [rclone](https://rclone.org/) to back up and restore PVC data to/from S3-compatible storage. All backup operations require a Secret named `s3-backup-credentials` in the **operator namespace**:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: s3-backup-credentials
  namespace: openclaw-operator-system
stringData:
  S3_ENDPOINT: "https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com"
  S3_BUCKET: "my-openclaw-backups"
  S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID: "<key-id>"            # optional - omit for workload identity
  S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: "<secret-key>"    # optional - omit for workload identity
  # S3_PROVIDER: "Other"    # optional - set to "AWS", "GCS", etc. for native credential chains
  # S3_REGION: "us-east-1"  # optional - needed for MinIO or providers with custom regions
```

Compatible with AWS S3, Backblaze B2, Cloudflare R2, MinIO, Wasabi, and any S3-compatible API.

**Cloud workload identity:** Omit `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and set `S3_PROVIDER` (e.g., `AWS`, `GCS`) to use the provider's native credential chain. Set `spec.backup.serviceAccountName` to a workload identity-enabled ServiceAccount (IRSA, GKE Workload Identity, AKS Workload Identity) so backup Jobs inherit the cloud IAM role. See the [Workload Identity section](docs/api-reference.md#workload-identity-cloud-native-auth) in the API reference for a full example.

**When backups run automatically:**

- **On delete** - the operator backs up the PVC before removing any resources. Subject to `spec.backup.timeout` (default: 30m) - if the backup does not complete in time, it is skipped automatically. Add `openclaw.rocks/skip-backup: "true"` to skip immediately.
- **Before auto-update** - when `spec.autoUpdate.backupBeforeUpdate: true` (the default).
- **On a schedule** - when `spec.backup.schedule` is set (cron expression).

If the Secret does not exist, backups are silently skipped and operations proceed normally.

**Periodic scheduled backups:**

```yaml
spec:
  backup:
    schedule: "0 2 * * *"   # Daily at 2 AM UTC
    retentionDays: 7         # Keep 7 days of daily snapshots (default)
    historyLimit: 3          # Successful job runs to retain (default: 3)
    failedHistoryLimit: 1    # Failed job runs to retain (default: 1)
    timeout: "30m"           # Max time for pre-delete backup (default: 30m, min: 5m, max: 24h)
    serviceAccountName: ""   # Optional: IRSA/Pod Identity SA for backup Jobs
```

The operator creates a Kubernetes CronJob that runs rclone to sync PVC data to S3. The CronJob mounts the PVC read-only (hot backup - no downtime) and uses pod affinity to co-locate on the same node as the StatefulSet pod (required for RWO PVCs). Backups use an incremental sync strategy: data is synced to a fixed `latest` path (only changed files uploaded), a daily snapshot is taken, and snapshots older than `retentionDays` are automatically pruned.

**Restoring from backup:**

```yaml
spec:
  # Path recorded in status.lastBackupPath of the source instance
  restoreFrom: "backups/my-tenant/my-agent/2026-01-15T10:30:00Z"
```

The operator runs a restore job to populate the PVC before starting the StatefulSet, then clears `restoreFrom` automatically. Backup paths follow the format `backups/<tenantId>/<instanceName>/<timestamp>`.

For full details see the [Backup and Restore section](docs/api-reference.md#backup-and-restore) in the API reference.

### What the operator manages automatically

These behaviors are always applied - no configuration needed:

| Behavior | Details |
|----------|---------|
| `gateway.bind=loopback` | Always injected into config; an nginx reverse proxy sidecar exposes the gateway and canvas ports for external access |
| Gateway auth token | Auto-generated Secret per instance; injected into config and env |
| Control UI origins | `gateway.controlUi.allowedOrigins` auto-injected from localhost + ingress hosts + `spec.gateway.controlUiOrigins` |
| `OPENCLAW_DISABLE_BONJOUR=1` | Always set (mDNS does not work in Kubernetes) |
| Browser profiles | When Chromium is enabled, `"default"` and `"chrome"` profiles are auto-configured with the sidecar's CDP endpoint |
| Tailscale serve config | When Tailscale is enabled, a `tailscale-serve.json` key is added to the ConfigMap for the sidecar's `TS_SERVE_CONFIG` |
| Tailscale state persistence | When Tailscale is enabled, node identity and TLS certs are persisted to a `<instance>-ts-state` Secret via `TS_KUBE_SECRET` |
| Config hash rollouts | Config changes trigger rolling updates via SHA-256 hash annotation |
| Config restoration | The init container restores config on every pod restart (overwrite or merge mode) |

For the full list of configuration options, see the [API reference](docs/api-reference.md) and the [full sample YAML](config/samples/openclaw_v1alpha1_openclawinstance_full.yaml).

## Security

The operator follows a **secure-by-default** philosophy. Every instance ships with hardened settings out of the box, with no extra configuration needed.

### Defaults

- **Non-root execution**: containers run as UID 1000; root (UID 0) is blocked by the validating webhook (exception: Ollama sidecar requires root per the official image)
- **Read-only root filesystem**: enabled by default for the main container and the Chromium sidecar; the PVC at `~/.openclaw/` provides writable home, and a `/tmp` emptyDir handles temp files
- **All capabilities dropped**: no ambient Linux capabilities
- **Seccomp RuntimeDefault**: syscall filtering enabled
- **Default-deny NetworkPolicy**: only DNS (53) and HTTPS (443) egress allowed; ingress limited to same namespace
- **Minimal RBAC**: each instance gets its own ServiceAccount with read-only access to its own ConfigMap; operator can create/update Secrets only for operator-managed gateway tokens
- **No automatic token mounting**: `automountServiceAccountToken: false` on both ServiceAccounts and pod specs (enabled only when `selfConfigure` is active)
- **Secret validation**: the operator checks that all referenced Secrets exist and sets a `SecretsReady` condition
- **Security context propagation**: when `podSecurityContext.runAsNonRoot` is set to `false`, the operator propagates this to init containers and applicable sidecars (tailscale, web terminal) so there is no contradiction between pod-level and container-level settings. Self-consistent sidecars (gateway-proxy, chromium, ollama) retain their own security contexts. The `containerSecurityContext.runAsNonRoot` and `containerSecurityContext.runAsUser` fields allow granular control over the main container independently of the pod level.

### Validating webhook

| `openclaw_autoupdate_applied_total` | Counter | Successful auto-updates applied |
| `openclaw_autoupdate_rollbacks_total` | Counter | Auto-update rollbacks triggered |

### ServiceMonitor

```yaml
spec:
  observability:
    metrics:
      enabled: true
      serviceMonitor:
        enabled: true
        interval: 15s
        labels:
          release: prometheus
```

### PrometheusRule (alerts)

Auto-provisions a PrometheusRule with 7 alerts including runbook URLs:

```yaml
spec:
  observability:
    metrics:
      prometheusRule:
        enabled: true
        labels:
          release: kube-prometheus-stack  # must match Prometheus ruleSelector
        runbookBaseURL: https://openclaw.rocks/docs/runbooks  # default
```

Alerts: `OpenClawReconcileErrors`, `OpenClawInstanceDegraded`, `OpenClawSlowReconciliation`, `OpenClawPodCrashLooping`, `OpenClawPodOOMKilled`, `OpenClawPVCNearlyFull`, `OpenClawAutoUpdateRollback`

### Grafana dashboards

Auto-provisions two Grafana dashboard ConfigMaps (discovered via the `grafana_dashboard: "1"` label):

```yaml
spec:
  observability:
    metrics:
      grafanaDashboard:
        enabled: true
        folder: OpenClaw  # Grafana folder (default)
        labels:
          grafana_dashboard_instance: my-grafana  # optional extra labels
```

Dashboards:
- **OpenClaw Operator** - fleet overview with reconciliation metrics, instance table, workqueue, and auto-update panels
- **OpenClaw Instance** - per-instance detail with CPU, memory, storage, network, and pod health panels

### Auto-Scaling (HPA)

Enable horizontal pod auto-scaling to automatically adjust the number of replicas based on CPU and memory utilization:

```yaml
spec:
  availability:
    autoScaling:
      enabled: true
      minReplicas: 1
      maxReplicas: 10
      targetCPUUtilization: 80
      targetMemoryUtilization: 70  # optional
```

When enabled, the operator creates a `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` targeting the StatefulSet and sets the StatefulSet's replica count to nil so the HPA manages scaling. The HPA is deleted when auto-scaling is disabled.

When auto-scaling is combined with persistent storage:

- Each replica gets its own PVC via StatefulSet `VolumeClaimTemplates` (named `data-<instance>-<ordinal>`)
- PVCs inherit `size`, `storageClass`, and `accessModes` from `spec.storage.persistence`
- Retention policy is `Retain` for both scale-down and deletion -- data is preserved
- If auto-scaling is later disabled, per-replica PVCs become orphaned and must be cleaned up manually

### Topology Spread Constraints

Spread pods across topology domains (zones, nodes) for improved availability:

```yaml
spec:
  availability:
    topologySpreadConstraints:
      - maxSkew: 1
        topologyKey: topology.kubernetes.io/zone
        whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule
        labelSelector:
          matchLabels:
            app.kubernetes.io/instance: my-instance
```

### Pod Annotations

Merge extra annotations into the StatefulSet pod template. Operator-managed keys (`openclaw.rocks/config-hash`, `openclaw.rocks/secret-hash`) always take precedence and cannot be overridden.

Useful for cloud-provider hints, such as preventing GKE Autopilot from evicting long-running agent pods:

```yaml
spec:
  podAnnotations:
    cluster-autoscaler.kubernetes.io/safe-to-evict: "false"
```

Phases: `Pending` -> `Restoring` -> `Provisioning` -> `Running` | `Updating` | `BackingUp` | `Degraded` | `Failed` | `Terminating`
